# lawyer-date-calculator
Simple date calculator that may be useful to lawyers who need to meet court deadlines. This is a python script that uses [PySimplyGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI) to create a graphical user interface. You can just run the script (date_gui.py) while using PySimpleGUI as a dependency, or use one of the executable files (made with [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller)) which already have all dependencies (including python).

## Run the Script
