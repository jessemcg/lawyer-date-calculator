## Installing

You can run the script (date_gui.py) while using PySimpleGUI as a dependency. But the easiest way is to download one of the following executable files (made with [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller)) which already have all dependencies (including python):

* [Linux Executable](https://github.com/jessemcg/lawyer-date-calculator/blob/main/date_gui_linux). Make sure the file is executable (with gnome, right click, go to properties, go to permissions, and check the execute box). Optional: Use an app like [Pin It](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.ryonakano.pinit) to create a .desktop file and incorporate it into your system.

* [Windows Executable](https://github.com/jessemcg/lawyer-date-calculator/blob/main/date_gui_windows.exe). Optional: pin to taskbar by dragging file to taskbar.
